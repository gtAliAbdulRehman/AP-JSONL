{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for MOD-1? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Some objects or concepts are so frequently represented that programmers can draw upon existing code that has already been tested, enabling them to write solutions more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence. ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for MOD-2? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept, real or imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors of the object or concept ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for MOD-3? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers create a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a hierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the subclasses ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for VAR-1? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers include variables in their code so that the same algorithm runs using different input values. ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for VAR-2? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers write code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating individual variables for each value.  ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for CON-1? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression determines the computed result. ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for CON-2? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for IOC-1? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " While programs are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences. ###"}
