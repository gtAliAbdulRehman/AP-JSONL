{"prompt": "What AP Exam preparation techniques does College Board suggest students practice in Unit 1 of AP Computer Science A? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " When writing programs, programmers use mathematical expressions to represent the relationships between quantities in the real world. This requires programmers to apply the meaning of specific Java operators to these formulas and expressions. While practicing writing these expressions, students should begin to understand that programs are composed of a series of statements that use arithmetic operators. During the early stages of learning to program, have students look at existing program code, and ask them to explain what it does rather than having them develop program code from scratch. When writing code, errors are inevitable. To learn how to identify and correct errors, students need exposure to the error messages generated by the compiler. The  ability to communicate to collaborative partners why a code segment will not compile or work as intended will aid students in being  able to correct the error and build working programs that accomplish specific tasks ###"}

This is the fun and rewarding part of computer science, because it involves putting a plan into practice to create a runnable program. In addition to developing their own programs, students should practice completing partially written program code to fulfill a specification. This builds their confidence and provides them opportunities to be successful during these early stages of learning. Programmers often rely on existing program code to build new programs. Using existing code saves time, because it has already been tested. By using the String class, students will learn how to interact with and utilize any existing Java class t ###"}

Students should be able to write program code that uses conditional statements for selection. Have students write their program code on paper and trace it with different sample inputs before writing code on the computer. Programmers need to make design decisions when creating programs that determine how  a program specification will be implemented. Typically, there are many ways in which statements can be written to yield the same result, and this final determination is dictated by the programmer. Exposing students to many different code segments that yield equivalent results allows them to be more confident in their solution and helps expose them to new ways of solving the problem that may be better than their current solution ###"}

Students should practice determining the number of times a given loop structure will execute. Spending time  analyzing existing program code provides opportunities for students to better understand how iterative structures can be set up and used to solve their own problems,  as well as the implications associated with code changes, such as how using a different iterative structure might change the result of  a set of program code. Students should be able to implement program code that uses iterative statements to represent nonlinear processes. Understanding how to write program code that repeats allows students to write programs to solve a wider variety of problems, including those that use data, which will be covered in Units 6, 7, and 8.  ###"}
{"prompt": "What AP Exam preparation techniques does College Board suggest students practice in Unit 5 of AP Computer Science A? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Computer scientists use computers to study and model the world, and this requires designing program code to fit a given scenario. Spending time to plan out the program up front will shorten overall program development time. Practicing elements of the iterative development process early and often will help create more robust programs  and avoid logical errors.because revisions to program code are rarely completed by the original author, documenting program code is very important. It allows programmers to more quickly understand how a code segment functions without having to analyze the program code itself. Well-written documentation includes  a description of the behavior, as well as the initial conditions that must be met for a code segment to work as intended. Sometimes students struggle to explain why  a code segment will not compile or work as intended. It helps to have students work with  a collaborative partner to practice verbally explaining the issues. The ability to explain why a code segment isn't working correctly  assists in the development of solutions ###"}
{"prompt": "What AP Exam preparation techniques does College Board suggest students practice in Unit 6 of AP Computer Science A? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Students should be able to implement program code to create, traverse, and manipulate elements in a 1D array. Traversing elements of a 1D array can be accomplished in multiple ways. Programmers need to make decisions about which loop structure is most effective given the problem they are trying to solve. Some loop structures, such as the enhanced for loop, only allow programmers to examine the data stored in a 1D array structure, while other loop structures allow the data to be manipulated. Students should be able to identify and correct errors related to traversing and manipulating 1D array structures. A common run-time error that programmers experience is an out-of-bounds error, which occurs when the program tries to access an element that is beyond the range of elements in a collection. Students should double-check the values of the index being used on at least the initial and final loop iterations to ensure that they aren't out of bounds ###"}
{"prompt": "What AP Exam preparation techniques does College Board suggest students practice in Unit 7 of AP Computer Science A? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Students need to consider the impact using arrayList rather than an array has on the structure of their program code. This includes considering the use of ArrayListmethods and the flexibility of a structure with  a dynamic size. For instance, the use of an arrayList will require students to analyze program code that uses method calls. Providing students with practice writing programs for data sets of undetermined sized-or at least larger than they would be  able to analyze easily by hand-presents a more relevant and realistic experience with data. Additionally, this requires students to focus more on the algorithm and ensuring that it will work in all situations rather than on  an individual result. With larger data sets, programmers become concerned with the amount of time it will take for their program code to run. Students should have practice determining the number of times a code segment executes; this can help them gain an idea of how long it will take to run a program on a data set of a given size. ###"}

Traversals of 2D arrays typically require a set of nested loops. Often the extra dimension of a 2D array is difficult for students to envision. Providing students with practice  analyzing and tracing traversals of a 2D array,  as well as providing them partial program code to complete, helps students take this more abstract concept and make it concrete  and replicable. because 2D arrays are traversed using nested loops, the number of times a code segment executes is multiplied. In a nested loop, the inner loop must complete all iterations before the outer loop can continue. It helps to provide students with sample code that will print the values in a 2D array. Teachers can an IDE that shows access to 2D arrays visually and keeps track of the execution count. ###"}
{"prompt": "What AP Exam preparation techniques does College Board suggest students practice in Unit 9 of AP Computer Science A? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " Students can design hierarchies by listing the  attributes and behaviors for each object and pulling common elements into a superclass, leaving unique attributes and behaviors in the subclass. By creating a hierarchy system, students only need to write common program code one time, reducing potential errors and implementation time. This also  allows for changes to be made more easily, because they can be made at the superclass level in the hierarchy and automatically apply to subclasses. During the development of a program, programmers often use comments to describe the behavior of a given segment of program code and to describe the initial conditions that are used. Students who develop the skill of explaining why program code does not work, such as methods being overloaded improperly or superclass objects  attempting to call subclass methods, are much better equipped to foresee and avoid these hierarchy issues ###"}
{"prompt": "What AP Exam preparation techniques does College Board suggest students practice in Unit 10 of AP Computer Science A? \n\n###\n\n",  "completion": " To better understand how recursion works, students should spend time writing their own recursive methods. Often, this can be overwhelming for students. One way to scaffold this skill for students is to require them to write a portion of program code, such as the base case, that can be used to complete the recursive method. Students should be able to determine the result of recursive method calls. Tracing the series of calls is a useful way to glean what the recursive method is doing and how it is accomplishing its purpose. Recursive  algorithms, such as sorting and searching  algorithms, often produce a result much more quickly than iterative solutions. Students also need to understand how many times statements in a recursive solution ###"}
