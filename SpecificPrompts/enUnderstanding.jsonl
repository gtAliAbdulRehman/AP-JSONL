{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for MOD-1?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Some objects or concepts are so frequently represented that programmers can \ndraw upon existing code that has already been tested, enabling them to write \nsolutions more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence.###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for MOD-2?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept, real \nor imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors of the \nobject or concept###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for MOD-3?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "When multiple classes contain common attributes and behaviors, programmers \ncreate a new class containing the shared attributes and behaviors forming a \nhierarchy. Modifications made at the highest level of the hierarchy apply to the \nsubclasses###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for VAR-1?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers include variables \nin their code so that the same algorithm runs using different input values.###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for VAR-2?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "To manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, programmers \nwrite code that groups the data together into a single data structure without creating \nindividual variables for each value. ###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for CON-1?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "The way variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression \ndetermines the computed result.###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for CON-2?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Programmers incorporate iteration and selection into code as a way of providing instructions for the computer to process each of the many possible input values###"}
{"prompt": "In AP Computer Science A, what is the College Board Enduring Understanding standard for IOC-1?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "While programs are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have \nunintended consequences.###"}
